# DBMS Using MySQL 🚀

Welcome to the **DBMS Using MySQL** repo! Here, we’re diving into the world of databases, SQL, and everything in between. This repository is perfect for beginners who want a hands-on introduction to MySQL and how databases work. 😄

## 📜 Overview

This repo contains starter SQL scripts and practice exercises designed to help you get comfortable with:

- Creating databases and tables 📊
- Writing SQL queries to insert, retrieve, update, and delete data 🖋️
- Setting up primary keys, constraints, and other table properties 🔑

Whether you’re a student studying DBMS for the first time or a developer refreshing your SQL skills, there’s something here for everyone!

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GUARDIANSOFCODE/DBMS-MySQL.git
    cd DBMS-MySQL
    ```

2. **Set Up MySQL**:
   - Install MySQL (if you haven’t already).
   - Start your MySQL server.
   - Use your preferred MySQL client (CLI, MySQL Workbench, etc.).

3. **Run the SQL Script**:
   - Open the `dbms_project.sql` file in your MySQL client.
   - Execute the script to create the `StudentDB` database and `Students` table.
   - Experiment with the provided CRUD operations to see SQL in action.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **dbms_project.sql**: The main SQL file where you’ll find all the basic SQL operations. This includes:
  - Database creation
  - Table creation with primary keys and constraints
  - Basic CRUD operations (Insert, Select, Update, Delete)

## 💡 Features

- **Sample Database and Table**: Includes a `Students` table with columns for `student_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `age`, and `major`.
- **Easy to Follow**: Comments in the SQL file explain each step for you to learn as you go.
- **Interactive Practice**: Edit the `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements to practice SQL commands and see real-time changes.

## 🛠️ Future Updates

- More complex queries for filtering, sorting, and joining tables.
- Sample data for larger datasets and advanced SQL practices.
- Database normalization and ER diagrams.
